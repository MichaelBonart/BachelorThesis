# APPLICATION

In 'genie16_analysis.ipynb' we apply our distance measure on on cross-sectional data of
patients suffering from selected kinds of cancer as described in chapter 4 of the bachelor thesis.

We analyze selected datasets from the top-level 'data/'- directory.

Additionally the plot for justifying the normalization of MHNs (section 2.6) is done here.
