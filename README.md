# An MHN-Based Distance Measure for Clustering Cancer Progression Events

This respository is attached to Michael Bonart's Bachelor's Thesis on clustering cancer progression events based on MHN-evaluated similarity and interchangeability.
The Bachelor's Thesis itself can be found in the 'docs/' directory.

All implementations can be found in the 'src/' directory.
All used datasets are located in the 'data' directory.
The main plots of the thesis were extracted from jupyter notebooks and stored in 'docs/grafiken', additional plots (plots of MHN) can be found in 'src/result_plots'
