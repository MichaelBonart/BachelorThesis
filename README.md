# An MHN-Based Distance Measure for Clustering Cancer Progression Events

This respository is attached to Michael Bonart's Bachelor's thesis on clustering cancer progression events based on MHN-evaluated similarity and interchangeability.


All implementations can be found in the 'src/' folder.
All used datasets are located in the 'data' folder.
The main plots of the thesis were extracted from jupyter notebooks and stored in 'docs/grafiken', additional plots (plots of MHN) can be found in 'src/result_plots'
